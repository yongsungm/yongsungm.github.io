One of my favorite aspects of computer science is problem solving, and one of my favorite aspects of problem solving is that there are countless different ways to solve the same problem. This first became apparent to me when I took a programming class in high school and even simple assignments would result in multiple correct answers from the students. The fascinating thing about this is that it demonstrates the different ways in which people’s minds work. However, there would be certain solutions to problems which I hated just because they were so different from the way I wanted to approach it. The first example that comes to mind is the bubble sort algorithm. The approach is so unintuitive to me that I find it annoying, especially since it’s not a particularly efficient sorting algorithm. Even though insertion sort has the same time complexity, I like it a lot more because it’s intuitive, and seems more like the obvious approach to sorting a list. It’s a lot like how someone would naturally sort a deck of cards, and if you read the algorithm, you probably wouldn’t be confused as to what it was trying to accomplish whereas I found bubble sort much more perplexing to analyze.

Though insertion sort is intuitive, it too is not a particularly efficient sorting algorithm, and in many cases it pales in comparison to other algorithms which I think are not at all intuitive. This demonstrates that though there are many ways to solve any problem, there are ways that are certainly better than others. There are also a lot of pretty good solutions already out there for frequently recurring problems. This is why it’s important to understand and be able to use design patterns. When it comes to software, there are countless applications that do similar things or have aspects that are equivalent. Any social media out there will have users create a profile and interact with each other in similar ways and thus most of them probably implement some of the same design patterns.
