Up to this point in my life, my approach to education was to put just enough effort into my studies to earn mostly A’s. 
I started this school year taking all of my courses online, and I kept up with this approach, barely hitting deadlines, 
cramming for tests, and focusing more on pursuing my hobbies than on my education and future career. One reason I am 
grateful to have started in-person courses again is that my education experience has since become much more involved. 
Partially due to this involvement, I’ve recently realized that I’m not doing as much for my major as I would like to. 
Computer science and programming are things which I genuinely enjoy. Programming had been a hobby of mine in the past, 
but recently I’ve been treating it as an obligation I fulfill in order to earn a grade. If I pick it up again as a hobby,
the progress I could make would be many times greater than if I limit myself to only completing my assignments.
<h2>What is RadGrad?</h2>
RadGrad is a resource offered at the University of Hawaii for undergraduate students in STEM which is meant to improve
their degree experience. It has a tool called “Planner” which makes it easy to see all of the relevant courses available
and to create a degree plan. While creating a degree plan was already possible through another UH resource called “Star”,
the RadGrad planner makes it much easier to discover all of the potential course one could take in order to complete their
degree. On top of this, Planner makes available all of the computer science related extracurricular activities I was 
previously unaware of such as hackathons, extra lessons, and other legitimately useful projects which are open to students
for collaboration. Another cool feature of RadGrad is that it allows you to select your specific interests within the 
field of computer science and add them to your profile. This not only allows you to connect with people who have similar
interests, it also exposes you to areas of computer science you’ve probably never heard of or thought about! If I had been
asked to list off as many fields of computer science I could think of, I probably would have been able to list 10 to 15.
RadGrad has 78, including things I’ve certainly never heard of such as bioinformatics and theory of computation.
