summary: A web application to connect UH students with similar commutes.
---

The purpose of this application is to make it easy for students attending the University of Hawaii at Manoa to organize carpools. The way it works is users create a profile including their name, photo, address, commuting schedule, and other optional fields. Then on the main page, they can view the relative locations of the other users on a map, and filter these users based on day, commute times, and whether they are a driver. When a potential car-pooler or "buddy" is found, the user can send them a message for coordination purposes. Users can also create group messages to organize a larger pool.

Contributions
</h2>
My contributions were mostly to create and improve functionality of the features we wanted to incorporate. The features I had a large part in implementing include:
<li>
The messaging feature which supports group messaging.
</li>
<li>
The markers which populate the map, along with the filtering capability.
</li>
<li>
The report function for misuse that gets reviewed by site admins.
</li>
<li>
The pages for viewing messages and reports.
</li>
<li>
The form for creating profiles.
</li>
<li>
The database collections.

Takeaways
</h2>
Through the creation of this project, I learned almost everything I know now about web development. Going through tutorials doesn't quite have the same educational value as tackling problems on your own (with the help of stackoverflow). Prior to working on this project, I had only a vague understanding of all the tools and concepts which were introduced to me in the course for which this project was made, however, I now have a much richer understanding as well as confidence in applying them.
