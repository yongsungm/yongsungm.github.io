The purpose of this application is to make it easy for students attending the University of Hawaii at Manoa to organize carpools. The way it works is users create a profile including their name, photo, address, and commuting schedule. Then on the main page, they can view the relative locations of the other users on a map, and filter these users based on day, commute times, and whether they are a driver. When a potential car-pooler or "buddy" is found, the user can send them a message for coordination purposes. Users can also create group messages to organize a larger pool.
