I planned and executed a 12 day 876 mile bicycle tour from Columbus, OH to<br>
Omaha NE. The goal of the trip was to make the journey without support and<br>
for as low of a cost as possible. To accomplish this, I bought a used<br>
bicycle and researched everything I would need to know to successfully <br>
complete the trip. I joined a bicycle co-op to gather advice and learn what<br>
I could from experienced cyclists. Here I learned basic bicycle maintenance<br>
such as how to change spokes and patch tires. I also physically trained <br>
beforehand by making day trips across the city and by using bicycle machines<br>
at the gym. Another preparation I made was to look up bicycle laws of states<br>
I would pass through to ensure I would be riding legally throughout the trip.

Below is an estimated breakdown of my expenses for this trip:

Bicycle - $160<br>
Tent - $130<br>
Pannier - $60<br>
Camp stove - $26<br>
Reflective vest - $12<br>
Helmet - $20<br>
Bicycle multitool - $40<br>
Sleeping bag - $40<br>
Sleeping mat - $13<br>
Misc (spokes, tire patches, personal items etc.) - $50<br>
Food - $40 a day * 12 days = $480<hr>
Total ~ $1030
