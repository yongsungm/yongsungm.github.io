I planned and executed a 12 day 876 mile bicycle tour from Columbus, OH to<br>
Omaha NE. The goal of the trip was to make the journey without support and<br>
for as low of a cost as possible. To accomplish this, I bought a used bicycle<br>
and researched everything I would need to know to successfully complete the <br>
trip. I joined a bicycle co-op to gather advice and learn what I could from <br>
experienced cyclists. Here I learned basic bicycle maintenance such as how to<br>
change spokes and patch tires. I also physically trained beforehand by making<br>
day trips across the city and by using bicycle machines at the gym. Another<br>
preparation I made was to look up bicycle laws of states I would pass through<br>
to ensure I would be riding legally throughout the trip.

Below is an estimated breakdown of my expenses for this trip:

Bicycle - $160<br>
Tent - $130<br>
Pannier - $60<br>
Camp stove - $26<br>
Reflective vest - $12<br>
Helmet - $20<br>
Bicycle multitool - $40<br>
Sleeping bag - $40<br>
Sleeping mat - $13<br>
Misc (spokes, tire patches, personal items etc.) - $50<br>
Food - $40 a day * 12 days = $480<br>
<b>Total ~ $1030</b>
<br>
<br>
The experience was challenging, but very positive overall. I met a lot of people<br>
along the way and passed through many small towns and types of areas which <br>
I had previously had very little if any exposure to. Although I was mostly self-reliant,<br>
I did have to rely on the kindness of strangers several times when I discovered <br>
that I lacked a tool I needed to repair my bike. Making camp in cornfields and <br>
random patches of woods was an adventure I still crave to this day. One thing I <br>
realized however, is that I probably wouldnâ€™t do something like this again by myself.<br>
I had a friend join me in Indiana and accompany me for a few days, and that was <br>
easily the highlight of the trip. I believe most experiences, especially adventures,<br>
are much better when shared with a friend.
